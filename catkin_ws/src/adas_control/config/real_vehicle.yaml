# Vehicle Control Parameters - Real Vehicle
# 实车控制参数 (预留)

mode: real

# Control - adjust based on actual vehicle
max_deceleration: 8.0   # m/s² - conservative for real vehicle
brake_gain: 0.12        # needs calibration
control_rate: 100.0     # Hz - higher rate for real vehicle

# Actuator dynamics - measure from actual vehicle
max_brake_rate: 3.0     # more conservative
brake_delay: 0.1        # account for CAN latency
