# Watchdog
watchdog_timeout_ms: 100.0  # Maximum allowed heartbeat age (relaxed for simulation)
                            # Real vehicle should use 50ms with C++ watchdog

# Plausibility Rules
max_decel_no_obstacle: 2.0   # Max decel (m/s²) when no obstacle within threshold
min_obstacle_distance: 50.0  # Distance threshold for plausibility check (meters)

# Safe State
safe_deceleration: 5.0  # Deceleration to apply in safe state (m/s²)
